			<h3>Objectives</h3>
			<p>As Los Angeles’ first and only liberal arts college, Occidental commits to provide a truly superior academic experience for its students. The problem with their existing site was that prospective and current students found it difficult to find all the information they needed in one easily accessible place. The marketing department had a difficult time editing their website with a modern look and feel.</p>

			<p class="editorial">There were two main users we were focused on. The first users are prospective students who are key to the success of a college continuing to push engagement. The second users are internal administration who need to edit and adjust pages to help convey the right content. We had a relatively small budget and a quick timeline for designing, building, and migrating a large amount of content. This factored into the amount of research we and they were able to do to get the best insights and research for our decisions.</p>

				<div class="column one-third">
					<h2>Analytics Review</h2>
					<p>With limited scope, we were only able to utilize Google Analytics to determine measurable areas of improvement. We were able to focus and set goals for reducing the amount of content, mobile usage, and tracking the journey that prospective students would take to find the programs available.</p>

				<h2>Designs</h2>
				<p>We created wireframes and designs that focused on showcasing the great campus life and student experience that students could expect. Those images were then supported by Alumni and Faculty stories to give a personal touch. The Admission process was a focal point in educating visitors of what is offered, through the main navigation and a large popup display on the homepage we made it easy to find.
				</p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<div class="half first"><h3>Previously the homepage lacked a sense of community and campus life.</h3><p>Adding large callouts to showcase the campus and surrounding areas as well as student testimonials.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The discover section helps students to understand the campus life and invite them to visit. Oxy found that if students visit they have a higher rate of enrollment.</li>
				<li>We wanted to gain the trust of students and parents. One of the strongest opportunities to support Oxy’s reputation is through student testimonials and stories from faculty members.</li>

			<div class="half first"><img alt="?" src="../../images/oxy/oxy-programs.png" /></div><div class="half"><h3>Individual academic program pages lacked the information that students want to see to get excited about their future.</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>We focused on showcasing the courses that students would take while in the program. Hearing from current students and learning more about the program faculty.</li>
				<li>Showcasing what careers and job titles past graduates have after completing the program.</li>
			</ol></div>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<div class="half first"><h3>The old website was responsive but outdated and difficult to navigate.</h3><p>We focused on making available as much information as possible to allow of exploring content at least two levels deep.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The mobile menu slides in from the left with expanding sections to navigate deeper. The mobile menu also combines the quick links menu that is available on desktop in a single tap</li>
				<li>Search functions were tailored to the mobile experience and the desktop adopts the same popup search field.</li>

				<div class="editorial"><h2>Design System</h2>
				<p>A design system is created to create the guidelines for the client and us to reference in the future and expand upon as needs change. The design system is created with simple HTML and CSS and is imported into any CMS with ease. We were able to use the colors, type, components, and other field settings in the many other projects we've collaborated with Oxy since the launch of the main site.</p></div>

			<h2 class="editorial">The Outcomes</h2>
			<p class="editorial">This project was a newly designed main website that focused on the prospective student, what they could expect, and encourage them to apply or visit the school. They found that if they could get someone on campus that they were more likely to enroll.</p>
			
<p class="editorial">We reduced the number of pages by 72% by identifying unnecessary or repeat pages. Fine-tuning the navigation and condensing pages for a simpler experience. We then saw a 37% increase in traffic to application pages and information. Mobile traffic and usage increased by 20% which was where a large part of their traffic was coming from anyways.

<h2>Using the design system across Oxy</h2>
			
			<div class="third">
				<h3>Obama Scholars Website</h4>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://obamascholars.oxy.edu/"><img alt="Table of content page layout." src="../../images/oxy/oxy-extended-01.png" /></a>
				<p>A quick redesign project to create a website for an Obama sponsored scholarship. We were able to utilize the Oxy design system we created to have a base design guideline.<br><a target="_blank" href="https://obamascholars.oxy.edu/">See Oxy Obama Scholars</a></p>
			</div><div class="third">
				<h3>Moore Lab Website</h4>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://moorelab.oxy.edu/"><img alt="Table of content page layout." src="../../images/oxy/oxy-extended-02.png" /></a>
				<p>The Moore Lab is one of the more popular spots on campus and needed its own look and feel. With the design system in mind, we could use the same components but give them a unique style to set them apart.<br><a target="_blank" href="https://moorelab.oxy.edu/">See The Moore Lab</a></p>
			</div><div class="third last">
				<h3>Oxy Campaign Website</h4>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://campaign.oxy.edu/"><img alt="Table of content page layout." src="../../images/oxy/oxy-extended-03.png" /></a>
				<p>Philanthropy is essential for scholarships and new projects to be achieved for a school. Along with a branding agency, we were able to design a website to showcase their projects and initiatives.<br><a target="_blank" href="https://campaign.oxy.edu/">See Oxy Campaign</a></p>
